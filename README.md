# BBC-Micro-bit-Project
This is a collection of mini projects that took place over a 10 week period. We dove into embedded systems and each task was implemented using the Micro:bit and additional hardware.

The first project involved using the Micro:bit and its pins to manipulate some LEDs we connected manually alognside a circuitboard. We configured the circuits ourselves and mapped them to pins on the Micro:bit so we could manually light them up. We manipulated the values of the pins using pointers to change the values at the pins for various functions. 

The second project involved using the on board LED display and a variety of timers and interrupts to create a collection of different faces. We had to manipulate the frequency of the lights to ensure the LEDS refreshed and displayed the faces correctly. 

The third project involved using the transmission capabilities of the Micro:bit. We had to manually configure a bit bang transmission method through trial and error to get the Micro:bit to transmit a series of bits passed to the function. 

The final project was the most fun. In this project we were given additional resources such as OLED screens and variable resistors to create something from scratch. I decided to create an etch-a-sketch game using the OLED screen and two variable resistors. It involved a lot of trial and error and another manually configured circuitboard but in the end I managed to finish the game. The source code is included inside the Etch-a-sketch zip.
